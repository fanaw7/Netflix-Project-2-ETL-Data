# Netflix-Project-2-ETL-Data



## **Project Overview: ETL**

The goal of the project is to take the role of a data engineer tasked with building a database that meets certain specifications.
Design of the database using a provided requirements file and data tables from IMDB.


## **Work Plan**
The collaboration type taken for this project was fully thorough group collaboration. Online meetings at a given time were carried on to work on each of the steps needed as one. We decided that this was the best way to make it work since we could all brainstorm along for the best ways to solve it and combine knowledge.

## **DATABASE REQUIREMENTS:**


1. An actors table with unique actors and actress' names that also contains a numerical field for age and a boolean field to identify if the actor or actress is currently alive, deceased, or unknown.

2. A film table that contains a character field for the original title, a numerical field for the average critic rating, a character field for the type of film (movie, television show, etc.) and a date-time field that has the runtime of the film in HH:MM (hours then minutes, separated by a colon) format. In addition to the required fields, there should be additional fields for other relevant metadata.

3. A producers table that contains only producer's names and links to the film table.

4. A characters table with unique character names that links the actors and film tables together.
